# StarPatterns
Creating different patterns using limited printf() statements and loops

This program is written by Shaqueir Tardif. You may use this program as open-sourced material to aid in the development of your own program. This program features patterns generated by user input. Feel free to make modifications and use the program however you'd like.

 !!!!!************************************************************************!!!!!
 *RULES:
 
 The objective of this project is to form patters using stars and printf() statements.
 No individual printf() statement can be reused within the program. Meaning, there can't be two locations
 in the same pattern where printf("*"); is located.
 *You can only use the printf() statement once in each segment.
